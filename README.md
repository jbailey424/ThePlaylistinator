Project for DATA 440!
While I still need to do background research and brainstorming, my idea is to make some sort of tool or model that suggests songs or creates playlists based on very specific qualities of songs. I plan to use the spotify API to retrieve song data, and possibly will make an interface for actually uploading generated playlists to the user's spotify profile.
